# SignPic String Generator

A command-line interface for generating strings for use with the [SignPic mod](https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/SignPic).

I made this because I was bored.

## Usage

Download `signpic-generator.pyz` from the Releases page. Open command prompt and execute it with `python signpic-generator.pyz --help`.

## Linux (and Mac maybe?)

Download `signpic-generator` from the Releases page and execute with `signpic-generator --help`.
